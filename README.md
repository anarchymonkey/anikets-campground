                        'Server has started message will be displayed'
#WARNING

* inclusion of node modules increases the character count by thousands thus it is not maintainable and thus not recommended
* as this is a trial project , node modules have already been given
* after the project ends , i am going to remove the node modules thus npm install before doing anything
